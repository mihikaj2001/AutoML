# Azure Automated ML

This is The result of having tested on Azure Machine Learning Studio, using Automated ML

## Input: 

Training dataset: Clean-credit-train.csv

Testing Dataset: Clean-credit-test.csv

Target column: **Class**



## Aim of the project:
To build a model that uses the given dataset, we need to determines if the creditcard transaction can be classified as legit (0) or fraud (1)

## Pre-processing Steps
The files already had the following tasks done oon them:
